# JavaScript Homework 08 (GoIT Neoversity) – Image Gallery

## Project Overview  
This project is part of the JavaScript Fundamentals: From Basics to Advanced Concepts course at GoIT Neoversity.
The task focuses on event handling, delegation, and working with external libraries to create an interactive image gallery with a modal preview of full-size images.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, I have practiced and reinforced the following concepts:

- Understanding the event lifecycle and event bubbling.

- Ability to detect the target element of an event and stop propagation.

- Applying event patterns such as event delegation and propagation control.

- Using destructuring and the object parameters pattern.

- Working with external libraries and connecting them via CDN.

- Handling DOM manipulation and dynamic HTML template creation with JavaScript.

## Task Description

Task: Gallery of Images

Create an image gallery with the ability to click on its elements and view full-size images in a modal window.
The project is built step-by-step using decomposition — dividing a large task into smaller, manageable parts.

## File Structure  
Each task is implemented in a separate file inside the project folder:  

goit-js-hw-08/ 

├── css
│ ├── styles.css
├── js/   
│ └── gallery.js  
├── index.html  
├── .gitignore  
├── .prettierrc  
└── README.md  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Click on GitHub Pages link in description to this project.  
3. Click on any image thumbnail — the full-size image will open in a modal window.
4. Check the console to see logged image URLs (for testing event delegation).

## Conclusions

- Practiced event handling and delegation in the DOM.

- Learned to dynamically generate markup from an array of objects.

- Gained experience in integrating third-party libraries via CDN.

- Built a fully functional interactive image gallery with modal image viewing.
